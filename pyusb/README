The PyUSB module provides for Python easy access to the host machine's Universa
l Serial Bus (USB) system.                                                     
Until 0.4 version, PyUSB used to be a thin wrapper over libusb. With 1.0 versio
n, things changed considerably. Now PyUSB is an API rich, backend neutral Pytho
n USB module easy to use.
