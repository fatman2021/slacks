Allegro 5 is the latest major revision of the library, designed
to take advantage of modern hardware (e.g. hardware acceleration
using 3D cards) and operating systems. Although it is not backwards
compatible with earlier versions, it still occupies the same niche
and retains a familiar style.

NOTE: Allegro 5 is wholly *incompatible* with Allegro 4 and earlier
versions, but both may be installed at the same time without conflicts.

Optional Dependencies: OpenAL, physfs, pulseaudio, dumb
(dumb not yet available from repo)
