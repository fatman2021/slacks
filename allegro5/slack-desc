# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

allegro5: Allegro 5 is the latest major revision of the library, designed
allegro5: to take advantage of modern hardware (e.g. hardware acceleration
allegro5: using 3D cards) and operating systems. Although it is not backwards
allegro5: compatible with earlier versions, it still occupies the same niche and
allegro5: retains a familiar style.
